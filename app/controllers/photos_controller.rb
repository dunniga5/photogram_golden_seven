  #   @photo_source = p.source
  #   @photo_caption = p.caption

# Now the controller needs to know how to handle each variable
# def show
#   @photo.source
#   @photo.caption
#   @photo.id
#   render ("show.html.erb")
# end


# This is the basic function of the "Show" action. After the hmtl portion has been created extract all of the variables and copy them here
# def show
